  <para>In this edition of Maven: The Complete Reference, we are beginning our
  transition to Maven 3.0. Maven 3.0 is approaching the end of a lengthy beta
  testing period, and it has already been in wide use by very large,
  mission-critical projects. We feel the Maven 3.0 is ready to for use, and
  this edition has added some supplemental information for developers who are
  looking to use Maven 3.0.</para>
